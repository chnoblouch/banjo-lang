Welcome to the docs for the Banjo language! The language and toolchain are very much a work in progress, so expect
things to crash. Examples can be found on the [online playground](https://marinohimself.ch/banjo/playground/). The
source code for the toolchain is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/chnoblouch/banjo-lang).
